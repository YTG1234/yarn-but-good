	COMMENT A marker interface for Gson serialisable pojos; the implementers make
	COMMENT sure that they have {@code SerializedName} annotation on all their
	COMMENT data fields so serialization works after obfuscation, and save/load of
	COMMENT such objects are controlled through another serializer.
